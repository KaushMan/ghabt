# ghabt gh-pages-source

Source for the github pages hosted website presentation for our project.

To update or redeploy the app (assuming *already currently in this branch*):
- Make changes, save. To preview, run `npm start`
- Commit changes. To deploy to Github Pages branch, run `npm run deploy`

Code directly ripped from [another Github Pages / React project demo website](https://github.com/cephcyn/WhereDoIPostMyMeme/tree/gh-pages-source) I built, then modified from there. For a guide on how to set this up, refer to the README in that branch (the specific version of the file at time of writing this reference is [here](https://github.com/cephcyn/WhereDoIPostMyMeme/blob/ee3d9f67a089289621ce818a123820925f3c889a/README.md))
